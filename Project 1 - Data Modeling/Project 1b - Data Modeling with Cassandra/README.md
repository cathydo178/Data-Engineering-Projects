# INTRODUCTION
A start up called **Sparkify** wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app.

Their analysis team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently there is no easy way to query the data to generate the results, since the data reside in a directory of CSV files on user activity on the app.

# PROJECT DESCRIPTION

As a data engineer, I will create an Apache Cassandra database which can create queries on song play data to answer the questions.
